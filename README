Qt viewer for Debian package files.
====================================

deb-qview is designed for Debian developers,
Debian applicants / sponsorees and the simply
curious.

By default, File|Open displays the list of
packages in the apt cache:
/var/cache/apt/archives/

deb-qview also loads .deb files directly from the command line.
This can be used  with file managers to open .deb files from a file
viewer window. This is not enabled automatically.

deb-qview can also load the .deb files listed in a .changes file, each
in a new window.

deb-gview will remain a .deb viewer rather
than being extended to cope with any .tar.gz
